"""
Given a square matrix of positive integers a, your task is to sort the numbers in each of its diagonals parallel to the secondary diagonal. Each diagonal should contain the same set of numbers as before, but sorted in ascending order from the bottom-left to top-right.

Example

For

a = [[1, 3, 9, 4],
     [9, 5, 7, 7],
     [3, 6, 9, 7],
     [1, 2, 2, 2]]
the output should be

diagonalsSort(a) = [[1, 9, 9, 7],
                    [3, 5, 6, 9],
                    [3, 4, 7, 7],
                    [1, 2, 2, 2]]
example

The diagonals parallel to the secondary diagonal in the initial matrix (left-to-right, bottom-to-top) are:

1
9, 3
3, 5, 9
1, 6, 7, 4
2, 9, 7
2, 7
2
For

a = [[10, 1],
     [7, 5]]
the output should be

diagonalsSort(a) = [[10, 7],
                    [1, 5]]

Given an array of positive integers a, your task is to calculate the sum of every possible a[i] ∘ a[j], where a[i] ∘ a[j] is the concatenation of the string representations of a[i] and a[j] respectively.

Example

For a = [10, 2], the output should be concatenationsSum(a) = 1344.

a[0] ∘ a[0] = 10 ∘ 10 = 1010,
a[0] ∘ a[1] = 10 ∘ 2 = 102,
a[1] ∘ a[0] = 2 ∘ 10 = 210,
a[1] ∘ a[1] = 2 ∘ 2 = 22.
So the sum is equal to 1010 + 102 + 210 + 22 = 1344.

For a = [8], the output should be concatenationsSum(a) = 88.

There is only one number in a, and a[0] ∘ a[0] = 8 ∘ 8 = 88, so the answer is 88.

For a = [1, 2, 3], the output should be concatenationsSum(a) = 198.

a[0] ∘ a[0] = 1 ∘ 1 = 11,
a[0] ∘ a[1] = 1 ∘ 2 = 12,
a[0] ∘ a[2] = 1 ∘ 3 = 13,
a[1] ∘ a[0] = 2 ∘ 1 = 21,
a[1] ∘ a[1] = 2 ∘ 2 = 22,
a[1] ∘ a[2] = 2 ∘ 3 = 23,
a[2] ∘ a[0] = 3 ∘ 1 = 31,
a[2] ∘ a[1] = 3 ∘ 2 = 32,
a[2] ∘ a[2] = 3 ∘ 3 = 33.
The total result is 11 + 12 + 13 + 21 + 22 + 23 + 31 + 32 + 33 = 198.

"""
Given an integer n and an array a of length n, your task is to apply the following mutation to a:

Array a mutates into a new array b of length n.
For each i from 0 to n - 1, b[i] = a[i - 1] + a[i] + a[i + 1].
If some element in the sum a[i - 1] + a[i] + a[i + 1] does not exist, it should be set to 0. For example, b[0] should be equal to 0 + a[0] + a[1].
Example

For n = 5 and a = [4, 0, 1, -2, 3], the output should be mutateTheArray(n, a) = [4, 5, -1, 2, 1].

b[0] = 0 + a[0] + a[1] = 0 + 4 + 0 = 4
b[1] = a[0] + a[1] + a[2] = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5
b[2] = a[1] + a[2] + a[3] = 0 + 1 + (-2) = -1
b[3] = a[2] + a[3] + a[4] = 1 + (-2) + 3 = 2
b[4] = a[3] + a[4] + 0 = (-2) + 3 + 0 = 1
So, the resulting array after the mutation will be [4, 5, -1, 2, 1].

"""
You are given two arrays of integers a and b of the same length, and an integer k. We will be iterating through array a from left to right, and simultaneously through array b from right to left, and looking at pairs (x, y), where x is from a and y is from b. Such a pair is called tiny if the concatenation xy is strictly less than k.

Your task is to return the number of tiny pairs that you'll encounter during the simultaneous iteration through a and b.

Example

For a = [1, 2, 3], b = [1, 2, 3], and k = 31, the output should be
countTinyPairs(a, b, k) = 2.

We're considering the following pairs during iteration:

(1, 3). Their concatenation equals 13, which is less than 31, so the pair is tiny;
(2, 2). Their concatenation equals 22, which is less than 31, so the pair is tiny;
(3, 1). Their concatenation equals 31, which is not less than 31, so the pair is not tiny.
As you can see, there are 2 tiny pairs during the iteration, so the answer is 2.

For a = [16, 1, 4, 2, 14], b = [7, 11, 2, 0, 15], and k = 743, the output should be
countTinyPairs(a, b, k) = 4.

We're considering the following pairs during iteration:

(16, 15). Their concatenation equals 1615, which is greater than 743, so the pair is not tiny;
(1, 0). Their concatenation equals 10, which is less than 743, so the pair is tiny;
(4, 2). Their concatenation equals 42, which is less than 743, so the pair is tiny.
(2, 11). Their concatenation equals 211, which is less than 743, so the pair is tiny;
(14, 7). Their concatenation equals 147, which is less than 743, so the pair is tiny.
There are 4 tiny pairs during the iteration, so the answer is 4.
