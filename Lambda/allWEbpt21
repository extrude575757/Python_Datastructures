@channel This is a pretty nice high level explanation of Redux. Definitely worth giving it a watch if you're struggling with understanding how Redux works.

@here Figured I would offer this out... As most of you know, this is my last guided project as a TL at Lambda School, and Sunday is my last 5th day will you.. i have enjoyed the time I've had with you all very much.. And I truly hope to see you all succeed.. with that being said... Tonight's lesson is one of the most difficult lessons to learn. And your project will not be simple. (It is complete-able though) i will be hosting after hours tonight from 9PM to 1030PM PST. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU ALL ATTEND. This is will quite possibly the last opportunity I will have to help you all out.
And before everyone asks, yes it will be recorded, but if you can male it, I highly suggest that you do. Thats the only way your questions will get answered.

so from a holistic view - Provider component accepts the store which contains our titleReducer which is defining our initial state. when we use mapStateToProps we are connecting our component to the store?

Step 1) dependencies that you need to install - 
1) redux
2) react-redux
3) redux-thunk**
4) redux-logger**
Step 2)
create src/store/actions/index.js
create src/store/reducers/index.js
create src/store/reducers/<application specific reducer file>
Step 3)
set up your basic application specific reducer file
```
const initialState = {
isLoading: false
}
export const <nameOfReducer> = (state= initialState, action) => {
switch(action.type){
default:
return state
}} 
```
Step 4)
src/index.js :
import {Provider} from "react-redux"
import {createStore, applyMiddleware} from "redux"
import rootReducer from "..path/..to/..reducer/..directory
const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk, logger))
<Provider store={store}><App /></Provider>
