That interview questions are best answered with the intent to explain every concept in full detail. The answer needs to be described as if the other person is going to solve the problem to that interview question right after you are done explaining the answer. It is also always okay to remember to ask the questionnaire if what you are explaining makes sense. There could have been a glitch or they may have heard something the wrong way without you knowing of it; so it will be very important to repeat your self if their understanding is hazy.Â
